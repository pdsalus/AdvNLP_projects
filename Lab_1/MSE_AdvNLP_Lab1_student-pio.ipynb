    "The goal of this lab is to perform tokenization of texts using the [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) toolkit or using BPE from [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece).  You will use the environment that you set up following the instructions of the introductory Jupyter notebook.  \n",
